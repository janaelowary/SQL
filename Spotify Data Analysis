# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table and explored the data using the following SQL. 

#1. What are the 10 most popular tracks?
select artist_name, popularity, track_name
from spotifydata
order by popularity desc
limit 10;

#2. Which artists had multiple (2 or greater) tracks in the top 50?
select artist_name, count(track_name)
from spotifydata
group by artist_name
having count(track_name)>=2
order by count(track_name) desc;

#3. What is the average danceability for each artist? 
select artist_name, avg(danceability)
from spotifydata
group by artist_name
order by avg(danceability) desc;

#4. Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
select artist_name, popularity
from spotifydata
group by artist_name
order by popularity desc
limit 10;

#5. What artist released the longest song?
select artist_name, duration_ms, track_name
from spotifydata 
group by artist_name
order by duration_ms desc
limit 1;

#6. What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?
select avg(danceability)
from spotifydata
where id between 1 and 10;

#7. Artists with popularity over 90% will be considered 'Top Stars'. 
Find what artists have an average popularity over 90%
with popularity_average_CTE as (
select s.artist_name, 
avg(s.popularity) as average_popularity
from spotifydata s
group by s.artist_name
)
select artist_name, 
average_popularity, 
'Top Star' as tag
from popularity_Average_CTE
where average_popularity>=90;
