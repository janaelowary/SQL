#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
select count(orderID) 
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where length(orderid)=6
and orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
select count(orderid) 
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where product='iPhone'
and length(orderid)=6
and orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
select distinct acctnum 
from BIT_DB.customers cust
inner join BIT_DB.Febsales Feb
on cust.order_id=Feb.orderid
where length(orderid)=6
and orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
select distinct price, product 
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where price in(select min(price) from BIT_DB.JanSales);

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
select sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product 
from BIT_DB.JanSales
group by product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
select product, quantity, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
from BIT_DB.FebSales
where location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
group by product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
select count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
from BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
left join BIT_DB.customers cust
on Feb.orderid=cust.order_id
where Feb.quantity>2
and length(orderid)=6
and orderid <> 'Order ID';
